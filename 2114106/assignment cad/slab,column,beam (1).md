# Reinforced Concrete elements:- Slab,Beam,Column
### Objective :- 
Designing the structural reinforced elements such as beams,columns,slabs,etc. 
### Introduction:-
Reinforced elements in FreeCAD's BIM (Building Information Modeling) environment opens up a world of possibilities for architects, engineers, and designers. Reinforced elements typically refer to structural components, such as beams, columns, slabs, and walls, that are reinforced with materials like steel or concrete to enhance their strength and load-bearing capacity.

### Procedure:-
 1.[Slab]()
 
 # **Procedure for design of reinforced slab**
1. Select any face of a previously created Slab  Arch Structure object. 

2. Then select  Slab Reinforcement from the rebar tools.

3. A dialog box will pop-out on screen as shown below.

4. Select the desired type of cover of reinforcement mesh (Top or Bottom).

5. Select the desired rebar type and other input data for rebars in parallel direction of selected face.

6. Now click Next or select Cross Rebars in list view.

7. Now select desired data for input data for rabars in cross direction of selected face.

8. Click OK or Apply or Finish to generate Slab reinforcement.

9. Click Cancel to exit the dialog box.

 
 2.[Beam]()
 # **Procedure for design of reinforced beam**
 
1. Select right face of a previously created beam  Arch Structure object having length along x-axis. Or select front face of a previously created beam  Arch Structure object having length along y-axis.

2. Then select  Beam Reinforcement from the rebar tools.

3. A dialog box will pop-out on screen.

4. Select the desired type of beam reinforcement.

5. Give inputs for data related to stirrups.

6. Click Next and the dialog box will be updated.

7. Set data for top rebars.7. Set data for top rebars.

8. Click Next and the dialog box will be updated as shown below.

9. Set data for bottom rebars similar to top rebars data.

10. Click Next and the dialog box will be updated.

11. Set data for left shear rebars.

12. Click Next and the dialog box will be updated as shown below.

13. Set data for right shear rebars similar to left shear rebars data.

14. Click OK or Apply to generate beam reinforcement.

15. Click Cancel to exit the dialog box.
 
 3.[Column]()
 
 # **Procedure for design of reinforced column**
1. Select any face of a previously created  Arch Structure object.

2. Then select  Column Reinforcement from the rebar tools.

3. A dialog box will pop-out on screen.

4. Select the desired type of column reinforcement.

5. Give inputs for data related to ties.

6. Click Next and the dialog box will be updated.

7. Select desired rebar type and fill data for main rebars.

8. Click Next and the dialog box will be updated.

9. Select desired rebar type and fill data for xdirection rebars.

10. Click Next and the dialog box will be updated.

11. Select desired rebar type and fill data for ydirection rebars.

12. Click OK or Apply to generate column reinforcement.

13. Click Cancel to exit the dialog box.
 
### Result:-
| S.NO | Element | File |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1| Slab | [Link](https://github.com/arunsharma13919/CADBIM/blob/main/2114106/FreeCAD/slab.FCStd) |  |-|
|2| Column |[Link](https://github.com/arunsharma13919/CADBIM/blob/main/2114106/FreeCAD/column.FCStd) |  |-|
|3| Beam |[Link](https://github.com/arunsharma13919/CADBIM/blob/main/2114106/FreeCAD/Beam%20Reinforcement.FCStd) | 
 
### Discussion:-

Designing reinforced concrete elements like beams, columns, and slabs in FreeCAD involves a systematic approach that combines geometric modeling with reinforcement detailing. Pay attention to dimensions, angles, and connections, as these will influence the structural integrity of your elements.
### Conclusion:-

In the summary the design of reinforced structural elements in FreeCAD provide us bundles of knowledge which could be used in the complex buildings where reinforced structures are required.
